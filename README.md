#circleCollectionControl

This control is a collection view with a UICollectionViewFlowLayout subclass.

* There is a scaling effect on items when scrolling.
* The centered item is selected automatically when scrolling ending.
* When you touch an item, it is automatically centered and selected.
* You can decide to show an "add" button.
* A long touch on an item show an alert view asking to delete the item (cannot delete the add button)


Technically this control is a subclass of a UICollectionView with its own constructor. it uses delegation to act with its controller when an item is selected.The circleCollectionView is included in a container view with layout constraint.
